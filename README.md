##### Details about the project: 
This project is a part of three different courses in agile project work, work methodology for developers and javascript. The task was to create a simple webshop that connects with an API. We chose Typescript in this project, and used Postman for testing. Throughout the project we also used GitHub projects for our sprint planning with continous sprint meetings and reviews with our product owners, AKA teachers of these courses.
